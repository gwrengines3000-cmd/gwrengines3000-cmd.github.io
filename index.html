                <h2>Who the Heck is this Stephen Fellow?</h2>
                <p>
                    Howdy, Stephen here. I'm the creator of this website and am a student at Fox Valley Technical College. I'm in the Web Design/Development IT major and currently on my second semester of my first year. I am 18 years old and hail from Clintonville about 30-40 miles northwest of Appleton. I have a great interest in programming, building websites and seeing the outcome. Genuinely a very satisfying experience and perhaps one day, a very lucrative career. Some of my favorite movies and books include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (movie)</li>
                        <li>Crisis on Infinite Earths (graphic novel)</li>
                        <li>The Percy Jackson Book Series</li>
                        <li>The Batman (movie)</li>
                        <li>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)</li>
                    </ul>
